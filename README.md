# LeetCode Solutions Repository

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! 🎉 This is a collection of my solutions to various LeetCode problems, carefully organized by difficulty and topic. Whether you’re prepping for coding interviews, honing your problem-solving skills, or just looking for alternative solutions to tough problems, this repo is here to help.

### What You’ll Find:
- **Organized by Difficulty**: Problems are categorized into Easy, Medium, and Hard. You can start from the basics or challenge yourself with harder problems as you improve.
- **Topic Breakdown**: Solutions are grouped by topics like Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Dynamic Programming, Trees, Graphs, and more. This helps you focus on specific areas to master key concepts.
- **Clear Explanations**: Each solution comes with a detailed explanation of the approach, including why I chose that method, the time and space complexities, and edge cases handled.
- **Optimized Code**: The code is written with efficiency in mind, focusing on both time and space complexity optimization whenever possible.
