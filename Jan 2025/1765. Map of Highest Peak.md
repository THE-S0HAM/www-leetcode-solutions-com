# *1765. Map of Highest Peak üèîÔ∏è*

## Problem Description üìú

You are given a 2D grid `isWater` of size `m x n` where each cell represents a land or water cell:

- `isWater[i][j] == 0` means the cell at position `(i, j)` is land.
- `isWater[i][j] == 1` means the cell at position `(i, j)` is water.

Your task is to assign each cell a height value following these rules:

1. The height of water cells is always 0.
2. The height of land cells must be non-negative.
3. The height difference between any two adjacent cells (north, south, east, or west) must be at most 1.
4. You should maximize the height of the highest land cell.

The goal is to return an `m x n` grid where each cell's height is assigned based on the given rules.

### Example 1:

**Input:**
isWater = [[0,1],[0,0]]

**Output:** [[1,0],[2,1]]

**Explanation:**
The heights are assigned as follows:
The water cell at (0, 1) has height 0.
The adjacent land cell (1, 1) has height 1.
The land cell (1, 0) has height 2, which is the maximum height.

### Example 2:
**Input:**
isWater = [[0,0,1],[1,0,0],[0,0,0]]
**Output:** [[1,1,0],[0,1,1],[1,2,2]]
**Explanation**: The maximum height possible is 2, and the land cells are assigned the heights in such a way that the difference between adjacent cells is at most 1.

### Constraints:
1 <= m, n <= 1000
isWater[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
There is at least one water cell in the grid.

## Approach üí°
To solve this problem, we use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to propagate the height values from the water cells to the land cells.
- Initialize Heights:
Create a result grid ans initialized with -1 to indicate that the height of the cell is not yet determined.
All water cells (value 1 in isWater) are assigned a height of 0 and are added to the BFS queue.

- BFS to Assign Heights:
Process the water cells first (since their height is 0).
For each cell, check its four neighboring cells (north, south, east, west). If a neighboring cell has not been assigned a height (still -1), assign it a height one more than the current cell‚Äôs height, and add it to the queue for further processing.

- End Result:
After processing all cells, the result grid ans will have the correct height assignment that maximizes the height of the land cells while ensuring that adjacent cells have a height difference of at most 1.

### Time and Space Complexity ‚è≥
**Time Complexity:** O(m * n)
We traverse each cell exactly once using BFS, processing each neighboring cell in constant time. Thus, the time complexity is linear with respect to the number of cells in the grid.
**Space Complexity**: O(m * n)
We use a queue to store the water cells and their neighbors, and a result grid ans of the same size as the input grid. Hence, the space complexity is proportional to the number of cells in the grid.
Code (JAVA) üíª
```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
  public int[][] highestPeak(int[][] isWater) {
    final int[][] directions = {{0, 1}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {-1, 0}};
    final int rows = isWater.length;
    final int cols = isWater[0].length;
    int[][] result = new int[rows][cols];
    Arrays.stream(result).forEach(row -> Arrays.fill(row, -1));
    Queue<Pair<Integer, Integer>> queue = new ArrayDeque<>();

    for (int r = 0; r < rows; ++r)
      for (int c = 0; c < cols; ++c)
        if (isWater[r][c] == 1) {
          queue.offer(new Pair<>(r, c));
          result[r][c] = 0;
        }

    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
      final int r = queue.peek().getKey();
      final int c = queue.poll().getValue();
      for (int[] dir : directions) {
        final int newR = r + dir[0];
        final int newC = c + dir[1];
        if (newR < 0 || newR == rows || newC < 0 || newC == cols)
          continue;
        if (result[newR][newC] != -1)
          continue;
        result[newR][newC] = result[r][c] + 1;
        queue.offer(new Pair<>(newR, newC));
      }
    }

    return result;
  }
}
