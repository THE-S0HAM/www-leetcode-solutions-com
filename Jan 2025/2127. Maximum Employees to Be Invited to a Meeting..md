# 2127. Maximum Employees to Be Invited to a Meeting üéâ

The problem can be found at the following link: [Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-employees-to-be-invited-to-a-meeting/)

## Problem Description üìú
A company is organizing a meeting and has a list of **n** employees, waiting to be invited. They have arranged for a large **circular table**, capable of seating any number of employees. 

The employees are numbered from **0** to **n - 1**. Each employee has a **favorite person** and they will attend the meeting **only if** they can sit next to their favorite person at the table. The favorite person of an employee is **not** themselves.

Given a **0-indexed** integer array `favorite`, where `favorite[i]` denotes the favorite person of the **i-th** employee, return the maximum number of employees that can be invited to the meeting.

### Examples: üí°
**Input:**  
`favorite = [2,2,1,2]`  
**Output:**  
`3`  

**Input:**  
`favorite = [1,2,0]`  
**Output:**  
`3`  

**Input:**  
`favorite = [3,0,1,4,1]`  
**Output:**  
`4`  

### Constraints:
-  n == favorite.length 
-  $$2 \leq n \leq 10^5 $$
-  $$0 \leq favorite[i] \leq n - 1 $$
-  $$favorite[i] \neq i \$$

## My Approach üõ†Ô∏è
1. **Graph Representation:**  
   Create an adjacency list to represent the favorite relationships among employees. Each employee points to their favorite employee.

2. **Topological Sorting:**  
   Use Kahn‚Äôs algorithm to perform topological sorting on the graph. This helps in determining the order in which employees can be invited based on their dependencies (favorite relationships).

3. **Cycle Detection and Path Length Calculation:**  
   During the traversal, detect cycles in the graph and calculate the longest path for each employee. If an employee's favorite is also their neighbor in the cycle, it indicates that both can be invited.

4. **Calculate Maximum Invitations:**  
   Finally, calculate the maximum number of employees that can be invited by considering both paths and cycles.

## Time and Space Complexity ‚è±Ô∏èüì¶
- **Time Complexity:** \( O(n) \)  
   The algorithm processes each employee once during topological sorting and cycle detection.

- **Space Complexity:** \( O(n) \)  
   Additional space is used for storing the adjacency list and other arrays.

## Code (JAVA) üíª

```java
import java.util.*;
class Solution {
public int maximumInvitations(int[] favorite) {
final int len = favorite.length;
int totalLength = 0;
List<Integer>[] adjList = new List[len];
int[] inDeg = new int[len];
int[] chainLen = new int[len];
Arrays.fill(chainLen, 1);
    for (int i = 0; i < len; ++i)
        adjList[i] = new ArrayList<>();

    for (int i = 0; i < len; ++i) {
        adjList[i].add(favorite[i]);
        ++inDeg[favorite[i]];
    }

    Queue<Integer> queue = IntStream.range(0, len)
                       .filter(i -> inDeg[i] == 0)
                       .boxed()
                       .collect(Collectors.toCollection(ArrayDeque::new));

    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        final int node = queue.poll();
        for (final int next : adjList[node]) {
            if (--inDeg[next] == 0)
                queue.offer(next);
            chainLen[next] = Math.max(chainLen[next], 1 + chainLen[node]);
        }
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < len; ++i)
        if (favorite[favorite[i]] == i)
            totalLength += chainLen[i] + chainLen[favorite[i]];

    int[] parent = new int[len];
    Arrays.fill(parent, -1);
    boolean[] visited = new boolean[len];
    Status[] state = new Status[len];

    for (int i = 0; i < len; ++i)
        if (!visited[i])
            detectCycle(adjList, i, parent, visited, state);

    return Math.max(totalLength / 2, maxCycleLen);
}

private int maxCycleLen = 0;

private void detectCycle(List<Integer>[] adjList, int node, int[] parent, boolean[] visited,
                         Status[] state) {
    visited[node] = true;
    state[node] = Status.VISITING;

    for (final int next : adjList[node]) {
        if (!visited[next]) {
            parent[next] = node;
            detectCycle(adjList, next, parent, visited, state);
        } else if (state[next] == Status.VISITING) {
            int current = node;
            int cycleLength = 1;
            while (current != next) {
                current = parent[current];
                ++cycleLength;
            }
            maxCycleLen = Math.max(maxCycleLen, cycleLength);
        }
    }

    state[node] = Status.VISITED;
}
```
