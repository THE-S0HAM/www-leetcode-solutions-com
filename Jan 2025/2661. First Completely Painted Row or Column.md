# *2661. First Completely Painted Row or Column*
The problem can be found at the following link: [Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-completely-painted-row-or-column/)

## Problem Description
You are given a 0-indexed integer array `arr`, and an `m x n` integer matrix `mat`. Both `arr` and `mat` contain all the integers in the range [1, m * n]. You will go through each index `i` in `arr` starting from index 0, and paint the cell in `mat` containing the integer `arr[i]`.

Your task is to return the smallest index `i` at which either a row or a column will be completely painted in `mat`.

### Examples:

**Example 1:**

**Input:**
`arr = [1, 3, 4, 2], mat = [[1, 4], [2, 3]]`

**Output:**  `2`

**Explanation:**  
The moves are shown in order, and both the first row and second column of the matrix become fully painted at `arr[2]`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:**
`arr = [2, 8, 7, 4, 1, 3, 5, 6, 9], mat = [[3, 2, 5], [1, 4, 6], [8, 7, 9]]`

**Output:** `3`

**Explanation:**  
The second column becomes fully painted at `arr[3]`.

## Approach Explanation

The goal is to keep track of painted cells in each row and column. As we paint cells, we need to check whether any row or column has been completely painted. The algorithm efficiently tracks this by:
1. **Mapping numbers to their corresponding positions in the matrix (`numToRow` and `numToCol`)**: This allows us to quickly locate the row and column of any number in the array `arr`.
2. **Counting the number of painted cells in each row and column**: We increment counters for rows and columns as we "paint" each number from the array.
3. **Checking for a fully painted row or column**: If any row or column reaches its size (`m` for rows or `n` for columns), we return the current index as the answer.

### Key Steps:
1. Initialize arrays to count how many cells in each row and column are painted.
2. Use `numToRow` and `numToCol` arrays to quickly map numbers in `arr` to their respective row and column in `mat`.
3. Loop through the array `arr`, for each element:
   - Paint the corresponding cell in the matrix.
   - Update the row and column counters.
   - If any row or column has been fully painted, return the current index.


### Time and Space Complexity
**Time Complexity:**
The time complexity is O(m * n).

Filling the numToRow and numToCol arrays takes O(m * n) time.
Iterating through the array arr and updating the counters for rows and columns takes O(m * n) time as well.
Thus, the overall time complexity is O(m * n).

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity is O(m * n).

We use additional arrays (rows, cols, numToRow, numToCol) to store the counts and mappings for all cells in the matrix, requiring O(m * n) space.

### Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int firstCompleteIndex(int[] arr, int[][] mat) {
        final int m = mat.length;
        final int n = mat[0].length;
        int[] rows = new int[m];
        int[] cols = new int[n];
        int[] numToRow = new int[m * n + 1];
        int[] numToCol = new int[m * n + 1];

        // Mapping numbers to their corresponding row and column
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i)
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                numToRow[mat[i][j]] = i;
                numToCol[mat[i][j]] = j;
            }

        // Paint each cell in order and check if any row or column is fully painted
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; ++i) {
            if (++rows[numToRow[arr[i]]] == n) // If a row is fully painted
                return i;
            if (++cols[numToCol[arr[i]]] == m) // If a column is fully painted
                return i;
        }

        throw new IllegalArgumentException(); // This line will never be reached because there's always a solution.
    }
}
```
