## Problem Description 📜
You are given a 0-indexed 2D array `grid` of size 2 x n, where `grid[r][c]` represents the number of points at position (r, c) on the matrix. Two robots are playing a game on this matrix.

Both robots initially start at (0, 0) and want to reach (1, n-1). Each robot may only move to the right ((r, c) to (r, c + 1)) or down ((r, c) to (r + 1, c)).

At the start of the game, the first robot moves from (0, 0) to (1, n-1), collecting all the points from the cells on its path. For all cells (r, c) traversed on the path, `grid[r][c]` is set to 0. Then, the second robot moves from (0, 0) to (1, n-1), collecting the points on its path. Note that their paths may intersect with one another.

The first robot wants to minimize the number of points collected by the second robot. In contrast, the second robot wants to maximize the number of points it collects. If both robots play optimally, return the number of points collected by the second robot.

### Examples:

**Input:**  
`grid = [[2,5,4],[1,5,1]]`  
**Output:**  
`4`  
**Explanation:**  
The optimal path taken by the first robot is shown in red, and the optimal path taken by the second robot is shown in blue. The cells visited by the first robot are set to 0. The second robot will collect 0 + 0 + 4 + 0 = 4 points.

**Input:**  
`grid = [[3,3,1],[8,5,2]]`  
**Output:**  
`4`  
**Explanation:**  
The optimal path taken by the first robot is shown in red, and the optimal path taken by the second robot is shown in blue. The cells visited by the first robot are set to 0. The second robot will collect 0 + 3 + 1 + 0 = 4 points.

**Input:**  
`grid = [[1,3,1,15],[1,3,3,1]]`  
**Output:**  
`7`  
**Explanation:**  
The optimal path taken by the first robot is shown in red, and the optimal path taken by the second robot is shown in blue. The cells visited by the first robot are set to 0. The second robot will collect 0 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 0 = 7 points.

### Constraints:
- `grid.length == 2`
- `n == grid[r].length`
- 1 <= n <= 5 * $10^4$ 
- 1 <= grid[r][c] <= $10^5$ 

## My Approach 💡

1. **Initial Setup:**  
   We start by calculating the total sum of points in the top row (first robot's path). We also initialize a variable to store the result (`res`), and a running sum (`bSum`) for the second robot's path.

2. **Process the Grid:**  
   For each column in the grid, the first robot will move along the path, and its path's points are subtracted from the total sum. We calculate the maximum of the remaining points that the second robot could collect, and store the minimum result during the iteration.

3. **Return the Result:**  
   Finally, the minimum result found during the process is returned, which is the optimal path the second robot will take to maximize the points it collects.

## Time and Space Complexity ⏳
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`  
   The algorithm iterates through each column of the grid once, performing constant-time operations within each iteration. Therefore, the time complexity is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of columns in the grid.
   
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`  
   The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space (ignoring the input grid), so the space complexity is `O(1)`.

## Code (JAVA) 💻

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public long gridGame(int[][] grid) {
        final int c = grid[0].length;
        long res = Long.MAX_VALUE;
        long tSum = Arrays.stream(grid[0]).asLongStream().sum();
        long bSum = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < c; ++i) {
            tSum -= grid[0][i];
            res = Math.min(res, Math.max(tSum, bSum));
            bSum += grid[1][i];
        }

        return res;
    }
}
```
