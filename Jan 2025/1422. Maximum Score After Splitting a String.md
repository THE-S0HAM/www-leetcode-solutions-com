## Problem Description
Given a string s of zeros and ones, return the maximum score after splitting the string into two non-empty substrings (i.e. left substring and right substring).

The score after splitting a string is the number of zeros in the left substring plus the number of ones in the right substring.
## Examples:

**Input:**  
`s = "011101"`  
**Output:**  
`5`  
Explanation:  
- All possible ways of splitting s into two non-empty substrings are:
- left = "0" and right = "11101", score = 1 + 4 = 5
- left = "01" and right = "1101", score = 1 + 3 = 4
- left = "011" and right = "101", score = 1 + 2 = 3
- left = "0111" and right = "01", score = 1 + 1 = 2
- left = "01110" and right = "1", score = 2 + 1 = 3

**Input:**  
`s = "00111"`  
**Output:**  
`5`  
Explanation:  
- When left = "00" and right = "111", we get the maximum score = 2 + 3 = 5

**Input:**  
`s = "1111"`  
**Output:**  
`3`

###Constraints:

- `2 <= s.length <= 500`
- `The string s consists of characters '0' and '1' only.`

## My Approach
1. **Initial Count of 1s:**
- First, we count the total number of 1s in the entire string. This will help us determine how many 1s are left in the right part as we move the split point.

2. **Iterate Over the String and Consider Possible Splits:**
- We iterate through the string and simulate possible splits. For each split, we maintain:
- leftZeros: Count of 0s in the left part of the split.
- totalOnes: This will keep track of how many 1s are left in the right part. As we move the split point, we decrement the count of totalOnes when we encounter a 1.
- At each split (index i), the score is calculated as:

3. **Maximize the Score:**
- For each split, we compute the score and update maxScore if the current score is greater than the previously recorded score.

4. **Return the Maximum Score:**
- After iterating over all possible splits, the maximum score is returned.

## Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we use only a few integer variables.

## Code (JAVA)

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxScore(String s) {
        int totalOnes=0;
        for(char c : s.toCharArray())
        {
            if(c== '1') totalOnes++;
        }
        int maxScore=0;
        int leftZeros=0;
        for(int i=0; i<s.length()-1; i++)
        {
            if(s.charAt(i)== '0') leftZeros++;
            else totalOnes--;
            maxScore= Math.max(maxScore, leftZeros + totalOnes);
        }
        return maxScore;
    }
}
```
