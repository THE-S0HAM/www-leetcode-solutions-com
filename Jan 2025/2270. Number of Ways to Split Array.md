# *2270. Number of Ways to Split Array*
The problem can be found at the following link: [Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-to-split-array/)

## Problem Description
You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of length \( n \). 

A valid split at index \( i \) satisfies the following conditions:
1. The sum of the first \( i + 1 \) elements is greater than or equal to the sum of the last \( n - i - 1 \) elements.
2. There is at least one element to the right of \( i \), i.e., \( 0 \leq i < n - 1 \).

Return the number of valid splits in `nums`.

### Examples:

**Input:**  
`nums = [10,4,-8,7]`  
**Output:**  
`2`  
**Explanation:**  
- Split nums at index 0. Then, the first part is [10], and its sum is 10. The second part is [4,-8,7], and its sum is 3. Since 10 >= 3, \( i = 0 \) is a valid split.
- Split nums at index 1. Then, the first part is [10,4], and its sum is 14. The second part is [-8,7], and its sum is -1. Since 14 >= -1, \( i = 1 \) is a valid split.
- Split nums at index 2. Then, the first part is [10,4,-8], and its sum is 6. The second part is [7], and its sum is 7. Since 6 < 7, \( i = 2 \) is not a valid split.
Thus, the number of valid splits in nums is 2.

**Input:**  
`nums = [2,3,1,0]`  
**Output:**  
`2`  
**Explanation:**  
- Split nums at index 1. Then, the first part is [2,3], and its sum is 5. The second part is [1,0], and its sum is 1. Since 5 >= 1, \( i = 1 \) is a valid split.
- Split nums at index 2. Then, the first part is [2,3,1], and its sum is 6. The second part is [0], and its sum is 0. Since 6 >= 0, \( i = 2 \) is a valid split.

### Constraints:
- 2 <= nums.length <= $10^5$
- $-10^5$ <= nums[i] <= $10^5$

## My Approach
1. **Total Sum Calculation:**  
   First, compute the total sum of the entire array `nums` to easily compare the sum of the right part during each iteration.

2. **Left Sum Iteration:**  
   Start iterating through the array and maintain a running sum (`leftSum`) of the elements from the left part. For each index \( i \), check if the `leftSum` is greater than or equal to the sum of the right part (which is `totalSum - leftSum`). If this condition holds true, it means a valid split exists at that index.

3. **Count Valid Splits:**  
   Increment a counter each time a valid split is found.

4. **Return the Count:**  
   Finally, return the count of valid splits.

## Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the length of the array. We iterate through the array once to calculate the total sum and once more to check for valid splits.
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(1) \), as we only use a few extra variables for calculations, and no additional data structures are needed.

## Code (JAVA)

```java
class Solution {
    public int waysToSplitArray(int[] nums) {
        long totalSum = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            totalSum += num;  // Calculate the total sum of the array
        }
        
        long leftSum = 0;
        int count = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; ++i) {
            leftSum += nums[i];  // Add the current element to leftSum
            if (leftSum >= totalSum - leftSum) {  // Check if leftSum is greater than or equal to rightSum
                count++;  // Increment count for valid split
            }
        }
        
        return count;  // Return the number of valid splits
    }
}
```
