# 1790. Check if One String Swap Can Make Strings Equal üåü

The problem can be found at the following link: [Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-one-string-swap-can-make-strings-equal/)

## Problem Description üìú

You are given two strings `s1` and `s2` of equal length. A **string swap** is an operation where you choose two indices in a string (not necessarily different) and swap the characters at these indices. Return `true` if it is possible to make both strings equal by performing at most one string swap on exactly one of the strings. Otherwise, return `false`.

### Example 1:
- **Input:** `s1 = "bank"`, `s2 = "kanb"`
- **Output:** `true`
- **Explanation:** Swap the first character with the last character of `s2` to make `"bank"`.

### Example 2:
- **Input:** `s1 = "attack"`, `s2 = "defend"`
- **Output:** `false`
- **Explanation:** It is impossible to make them equal with one string swap.

### Example 3:
- **Input:** `s1 = "kelb"`, `s2 = "kelb"`
- **Output:** `true`
- **Explanation:** The two strings are already equal, so no string swap operation is required.

## My Approach üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Identify Differences:**  
   First, we need to find the positions where the characters of the two strings `s1` and `s2` are different. This can be achieved by comparing the strings character by character.

2. **Check the Number of Differences:**  
   - If there are **no differences** (i.e., both strings are already equal), return `true`.  
   - If there are exactly **two differences**, check if swapping the characters at these positions in one of the strings makes the strings equal. If this is the case, return `true`.

3. **Handle More Than Two Differences:**  
   If there are more than two differences, return `false` as we can only swap two characters.

## Time and Space Complexity ‚è±Ô∏èüì¶

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`  
  We traverse both strings once to find the differences, where `n` is the length of the strings.

- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`  
  We store the indices of the differences in a list, which could be of size `n` in the worst case.

## Code (Java) üíª

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean areAlmostEqual(String s1, String s2) {
        List<Integer> diffIndices = new ArrayList<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < s1.length(); ++i)
            if (s1.charAt(i) != s2.charAt(i))
                diffIndices.add(i);

        return diffIndices.isEmpty() ||
            (diffIndices.size() == 2 &&
             s1.charAt(diffIndices.get(0)) == s2.charAt(diffIndices.get(1)) &&
             s1.charAt(diffIndices.get(1)) == s2.charAt(diffIndices.get(0)));
    }
}
```

### Code (Python) üêç

```python
class Solution:
    def areAlmostEqual(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:
        diffIndices = []

        for i in range(len(s1)):
            if s1[i] != s2[i]:
                diffIndices.append(i)

        return not diffIndices or (
            len(diffIndices) == 2 and
            s1[diffIndices[0]] == s2[diffIndices[1]] and
            s1[diffIndices[1]] == s2[diffIndices[0]]
        )

```

### Code (C++) üî©

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool areAlmostEqual(string s1, string s2) {
        vector<int> diffIndices;

        for (int i = 0; i < s1.length(); ++i) {
            if (s1[i] != s2[i]) {
                diffIndices.push_back(i);
            }
        }

        return diffIndices.empty() || (
            diffIndices.size() == 2 && 
            s1[diffIndices[0]] == s2[diffIndices[1]] &&
            s1[diffIndices[1]] == s2[diffIndices[0]]
        );
    }
};
```
