# 3174. Clear Digits üßπ

The problem can be found at the following link: [Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/clear-digits/)

## Problem Description üìú

You are given a string `s`.  

Your task is to remove all digits by repeatedly performing the following operation:  
- Delete the **first digit** and the closest **non-digit character to its left**.

Return the resulting string after removing all digits.

### Example 1:

- **Input:** `s = "abc"`  
  **Output:** `"abc"`  
  **Explanation:** There is no digit in the string.

### Example 2:

- **Input:** `s = "cb34"`  
  **Output:** `""`  
  **Explanation:**  
  1. Apply the operation on `s[2]` ‚Üí `"c4"`  
  2. Apply the operation on `s[1]` ‚Üí `""`.

### Constraints:
- `1 <= s.length <= 100`
- `s` consists only of lowercase English letters and digits.
- The input is generated such that it is possible to delete all digits.

## My Approach üõ†Ô∏è

This problem can be solved efficiently using a **stack**:
1. Use a stack to keep track of non-digit characters.
2. Iterate through the string character by character:
   - If the character is a **digit**, remove the top element from the stack (if any) since it's the closest non-digit to the left.
   - If the character is a **letter**, add it to the stack.
3. After processing all characters, the stack will contain the final string with all digits removed.

### Key Points:
- A stack is ideal for this problem because it allows efficient removal of the "closest" non-digit character to the left.
- The approach ensures that we process each character only once.

## Time and Space Complexity ‚è±Ô∏èüì¶

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)  
  We iterate through the string once, where `n` is the length of the string.
  
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)  
  The stack stores at most `n` characters.

## Code (Java) üíª

```java
class Solution {
    public String clearDigits(String s) {
        StringBuilder str = new StringBuilder();
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (Character.isDigit(c)) {
                if (str.length() > 0) {
                    str.setLength(str.length() - 1); // Remove the last non-digit
                }
            } else {
                str.append(c); // Add non-digit to the result
            }
        }
        return str.toString();
    }
}
```

### Code (Python) üêç
```python

class Solution:
    def clearDigits(self, s: str) -> str:
        stack = []
        for c in s:
            if c.isdigit():
                if stack:
                    stack.pop()  # Remove the last non-digit
            else:
                stack.append(c)  # Add non-digit to the stack
        return ''.join(stack)
```

### Code (C++) üî©

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string clearDigits(string s) {
        string result = "";
        for (char c : s) {
            if (isdigit(c)) {
                if (!result.empty()) {
                    result.pop_back(); // Remove the last non-digit
                }
            } else {
                result.push_back(c); // Add non-digit to the result
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```
