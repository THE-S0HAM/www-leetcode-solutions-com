# 1726. Tuple with Same Product üß©

The problem can be found at the following link: [Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/tuple-with-same-product/)

## Problem Description üìú

Given an array `nums` of distinct positive integers, we need to find the number of tuples `(a, b, c, d)` such that `a * b = c * d`, where `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are elements from the `nums` array, and each of the elements are distinct.

### Example 1:

- **Input:** `nums = [2, 3, 4, 6]`  
  **Output:** `8`  
  **Explanation:** The 8 valid tuples are:  
  `(2,6,3,4)`, `(2,6,4,3)`, `(6,2,3,4)`, `(6,2,4,3)`,  
  `(3,4,2,6)`, `(4,3,2,6)`, `(3,4,6,2)`, `(4,3,6,2)`.

### Example 2:

- **Input:** `nums = [1, 2, 4, 5, 10]`  
  **Output:** `16`  
  **Explanation:** The 16 valid tuples are:  
  `(1,10,2,5)`, `(1,10,5,2)`, `(10,1,2,5)`, `(10,1,5,2)`,  
  `(2,5,1,10)`, `(2,5,10,1)`, `(5,2,1,10)`, `(5,2,10,1)`,  
  `(2,10,4,5)`, `(2,10,5,4)`, `(10,2,4,5)`, `(10,2,5,4)`,  
  `(4,5,2,10)`, `(4,5,10,2)`, `(5,4,2,10)`, `(5,4,10,2)`.

## My Approach üõ†Ô∏è

To solve this problem efficiently, we use a **hash map** to track products of pairs of numbers.

### Steps:
1. **Initialize a frequency map (`freq`)**: This will store the number of times a product of two numbers appears.
2. **Iterate through pairs of numbers**:  
   - For each unique pair `(i, j)`, calculate the product `p = nums[i] * nums[j]`.
   - Add to the result `res` the number of times this product has already appeared in previous pairs (using `freq`).
   - Store the product `p` in `freq` for future pairs.
3. **Multiply by 8**: For each valid pair of products that satisfy `a * b = c * d`, there are 8 valid permutations of the tuple.

This approach works because we're leveraging the fact that every unique pair of numbers forms a unique product, and we can easily count how many times a product has been formed using previous pairs.

## Time and Space Complexity ‚è±Ô∏èüì¶

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n^2)`  
  We iterate through all pairs of numbers, where `n` is the length of the array. Thus, the time complexity is quadratic in terms of the array size.

- **Space Complexity:** `O(n^2)`  
  We store all the pair products in a hash map, so the space complexity is proportional to the number of pairs, which is `O(n^2)`.

## Code (Java) üíª

```java
class Solution {
    public int tupleSameProduct(int[] nums) {
        int res = 0;
        Map<Integer, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j) {
                int p = nums[i] * nums[j];
                res += freq.getOrDefault(p, 0) * 8;
                freq.merge(p, 1, Integer::sum);
            }
        }

        return res;
    }
}

```

### Code (Python) üêç

```python
class Solution:
    def tupleSameProduct(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        res = 0
        freq = {}

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            for j in range(i):
                p = nums[i] * nums[j]
                res += freq.get(p, 0) * 8
                freq[p] = freq.get(p, 0) + 1

        return res
```

### Code (C++) üî©

```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    int tupleSameProduct(vector<int>& nums) {
        int res = 0;
        unordered_map<int, int> freq;

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j) {
                int p = nums[i] * nums[j];
                res += freq[p] * 8;
                freq[p]++;
            }
        }

        return res;
    }
};
```
