# 1910. Remove All Occurrences of a Substring ‚úÇÔ∏è

The problem can be found at the following link: [Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-all-occurrences-of-a-substring/)

## Problem Description üìú

Given two strings `s` and `part`, perform the following operation on `s` until all occurrences of the substring `part` are removed:

- Find the leftmost occurrence of the substring `part` and remove it from `s`.
- Return `s` after removing all occurrences of `part`.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

### Example 1:

- **Input:** `s = "daabcbaabcbc"`, `part = "abc"`
  **Output:** `"dab"`
  **Explanation:**  
  - Remove "abc" starting at index 2: `"dabaabcbc"`
  - Remove "abc" starting at index 4: `"dababc"`
  - Remove "abc" starting at index 3: `"dab"`
  - No more "abc" left, return `"dab"`.

### Example 2:

- **Input:** `s = "axxxxyyyyb"`, `part = "xy"`
  **Output:** `"ab"`
  **Explanation:**  
  - Remove "xy" at index 4: `"axxxyyyb"`
  - Remove "xy" at index 3: `"axxyyb"`
  - Remove "xy" at index 2: `"axyb"`
  - Remove "xy" at index 1: `"ab"`
  - No more "xy" left, return `"ab"`.

### Constraints:
- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= part.length <= 1000`
- `s` and `part` consist of lowercase English letters.

## My Approach üõ†Ô∏è

The best way to solve this problem efficiently is by using a **StringBuilder (Java) or a Stack-like approach (Python & C++)**:

1. Iterate through the string character by character.
2. Use a **StringBuilder (Java)** or a **stack-like approach (Python & C++)** to build the result string dynamically.
3. Whenever the last `k` characters of our result match `part`, remove them.
4. Continue the process until no occurrences of `part` remain in `s`.

### Key Points:
- **Efficient in removing substrings** by leveraging dynamic string construction.
- **Avoids unnecessary repeated traversal** of `s`, making it more optimized.

## Time and Space Complexity ‚è±Ô∏èüì¶

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n * k)`, where `n` is the length of `s` and `k` is the length of `part`. Each removal operation can take up to `O(k)`, and we repeat this up to `O(n/k)` times in the worst case.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`, as we use additional space for the result string.

## Code (Java) üíª

```java
class Solution {
    public String removeOccurrences(String s, String part) {
        final int n = s.length();
        final int k = part.length();
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(s);
        int j = 0; // index for sb
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            sb.setCharAt(j++, s.charAt(i));
            if (j >= k && sb.substring(j - k, j).toString().equals(part)) {
                j -= k; // Remove part from sb
            }
        }
        return sb.substring(0, j).toString(); 
    }
}
```

## Code (Python) üêç

```python
class Solution:
    def removeOccurrences(self, s: str, part: str) -> str:
        stack = []
        k = len(part)
        
        for c in s:
            stack.append(c)
            if len(stack) >= k and ''.join(stack[-k:]) == part:
                del stack[-k:] # Remove last k characters
        
        return ''.join(stack)
```

---

## Code (C++) üî©

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string removeOccurrences(string s, string part) {
        string result = "";
        int k = part.size();
        
        for (char c : s) {
            result.push_back(c);
            if (result.size() >= k && result.substr(result.size() - k) == part) {
                result.erase(result.size() - k, k);
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```
