# 2698. Find the Punishment Number of an Integer 🔢

The problem can be found at the following link: [Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-punishment-number-of-an-integer/)

## Problem Description 📜

Given a positive integer `n`, return the punishment number of `n`.

The punishment number of `n` is defined as the sum of the squares of all integers `i` such that:

1. `1 <= i <= n`
2. The decimal representation of `i * i` can be partitioned into contiguous substrings such that the sum of the integer values of these substrings equals `i`.

### Example 1:

- **Input:** `n = 10`  
  **Output:** `182`  
  **Explanation:** There are exactly 3 integers `i` in the range `[1, 10]` that satisfy the conditions:
  - `1` since `1 * 1 = 1`
  - `9` since `9 * 9 = 81` and `81` can be partitioned into `8` and `1` with a sum equal to `9`.
  - `10` since `10 * 10 = 100` and `100` can be partitioned into `10` and `0` with a sum equal to `10`.
  - Hence, the punishment number of `10` is `1 + 81 + 100 = 182`.

### Example 2:

- **Input:** `n = 37`  
  **Output:** `1478`  
  **Explanation:** There are exactly 4 integers `i` in the range `[1, 37]` that satisfy the conditions:
  - `1` since `1 * 1 = 1`.
  - `9` since `9 * 9 = 81` and `81` can be partitioned into `8 + 1`.
  - `10` since `10 * 10 = 100` and `100` can be partitioned into `10 + 0`.
  - `36` since `36 * 36 = 1296` and `1296` can be partitioned into `1 + 29 + 6`.
  - Hence, the punishment number of `37` is `1 + 81 + 100 + 1296 = 1478`.

### Constraints:
- `1 <= n <= 1000`

## My Approach 🛠️

To solve this problem, we need to check for each number `i` if its square can be split into contiguous parts summing up to `i` itself. We use **recursion and backtracking** for this purpose:

1. Iterate through numbers from `1` to `n`.
2. Square each number and convert it to a string.
3. Use a recursive helper function to check if the squared number can be split into valid substrings that sum up to `i`.
4. If a valid partition exists, add `i^2` to the total sum.
5. Return the final accumulated sum as the punishment number.

### Key Observations:
- **Backtracking is useful** to try all possible partitions of the squared number.
- **Recursion helps** in checking different substring combinations dynamically.
- **String manipulation is key**, since we need to split numbers efficiently.

## Time and Space Complexity ⏱️📦

- **Time Complexity:** O(n * k), where `k` is the number of digits in `i^2`. This is because for each number, we check all possible partitions.
- **Space Complexity:** O(k) due to recursive function calls and string storage.

## Code Implementations 💻

### Java Implementation ☕

```java
class Solution {
  public int punishmentNumber(int n) {
    int ans = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
      if (isPossible(0, 0, String.valueOf(i * i), 0, i))
        ans += i * i;
    return ans;
  }
  
  private boolean isPossible(int accumulate, int running, String numChars, int s, int target) {
    if (s == numChars.length())
      return target == accumulate + running;
    final int d = numChars.charAt(s) - '0';
    return isPossible(accumulate, running * 10 + d, numChars, s + 1, target) ||
        isPossible(accumulate + running, d, numChars, s + 1, target);
  }
}
```

### Python Implementation 🐍

```python
class Solution:
    def punishmentNumber(self, n: int) -> int:
        def isPossible(accumulate, running, numChars, s, target):
            if s == len(numChars):
                return target == accumulate + running
            d = int(numChars[s])
            return isPossible(accumulate, running * 10 + d, numChars, s + 1, target) or                    isPossible(accumulate + running, d, numChars, s + 1, target)
        
        ans = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if isPossible(0, 0, str(i * i), 0, i):
                ans += i * i
        return ans
```

### C++ Implementation 🔩

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPossible(int accumulate, int running, string numChars, int s, int target) {
        if (s == numChars.size())
            return target == accumulate + running;
        int d = numChars[s] - '0';
        return isPossible(accumulate, running * 10 + d, numChars, s + 1, target) ||
               isPossible(accumulate + running, d, numChars, s + 1, target);
    }
    
    int punishmentNumber(int n) {
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            if (isPossible(0, 0, to_string(i * i), 0, i)) {
                ans += i * i;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
