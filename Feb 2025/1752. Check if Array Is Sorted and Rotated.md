# 1752. Check if Array Is Sorted and Rotated 🎉
The problem can be found at the following link: [Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-array-is-sorted-and-rotated/description/)

## Problem Description 📜
Given an array `nums`, return `true` if the array was originally sorted in non-decreasing order and then rotated some number of positions (including zero). Otherwise, return `false`. The array can contain duplicates.

### Examples:
💡
- **Input:** `nums = [3,4,5,1,2]`  
  **Output:** `true`  
  **Explanation:** The original sorted array is `[1,2,3,4,5]`, which can be rotated to form the given array.

- **Input:** `nums = [2,1,3,4]`  
  **Output:** `false`  
  **Explanation:** There is no sorted array that can be rotated to form the given array.

- **Input:** `nums = [1,2,3]`  
  **Output:** `true`  
  **Explanation:** The original sorted array is `[1,2,3]`, which can be rotated by 0 positions.

### Constraints:
- `1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 100`
- `1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 100`

## My Approach 🛠️
1. **Count Rotations:**  
   We'll iterate through the array and count how many times we find a situation where an element is greater than the next element. This indicates a "rotation point."

2. **Check Conditions:**  
   If we find more than one rotation point during our iteration, we can conclude that the array cannot be formed by a single rotation of a sorted array.

3. **Return Result:**  
   If we find one or zero rotation points, we return `true`, indicating that the array could be sorted and then rotated.

### Time and Space Complexity ⏱️📦
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`  
  We traverse the array once where `n` is the length of the array.

- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`  
  We use a constant amount of space since we're only storing a few variables.

### Code (JAVA) 💻
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean check(int[] nums) {
        final int n = nums.length;
        int rotates = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (nums[i] > nums[(i + 1) % n] && ++rotates > 1) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

Code (Python) 🐍

```python
class Solution:
    def check(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        n = len(nums)
        rotates = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            if nums[i] > nums[(i + 1) % n]:
                rotates += 1
                if rotates > 1:
                    return False
        return True
```

Code (C++) 🔩
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool check(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int rotates = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (nums[i] > nums[(i + 1) % n]) {
                rotates++;
                if (rotates > 1) return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```
