# 3105. Longest Strictly Increasing or Strictly Decreasing Subarray 🌟
The problem can be found at the following link: [Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-strictly-increasing-or-strictly-decreasing-subarray/)

## Problem Description 📜
Given an array `nums`, return the length of the longest subarray of `nums` which is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.

### Examples:
💡
- **Input:** `nums = [1,4,3,3,2]`  
  **Output:** `2`  
  **Explanation:** The strictly increasing subarrays are [1], [2], [3], [3], [4], and [1,4].  
  The strictly decreasing subarrays are [1], [2], [3], [3], [4], [3,2], and [4,3].  
  The longest subarray is of length 2.

- **Input:** `nums = [3,3,3,3]`  
  **Output:** `1`  
  **Explanation:** All subarrays are non-increasing or non-decreasing, so the longest subarray is of length 1.

- **Input:** `nums = [3,2,1]`  
  **Output:** `3`  
  **Explanation:** The strictly decreasing subarrays are [3], [2], [1], [3,2], [2,1], and [3,2,1].  
  The longest subarray is of length 3.

### Constraints:
- `1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 50`
- `1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 50`

## My Approach 🛠️
1. **Track Increasing and Decreasing Sequences:**  
   The goal is to track two variables — one for the length of the current increasing subarray and one for the current decreasing subarray.

2. **Traverse the Array:**  
   As we iterate through the array:
   - If the current element is greater than the previous one, we extend the increasing sequence.
   - If it's less, we extend the decreasing sequence.
   - If it’s equal, we reset both sequences to 1, because a strictly increasing or decreasing sequence cannot have equal values.

3. **Update Maximum Length:**  
   After each step, we update the maximum length of either sequence if it's longer than the previously found maximum.

4. **Return the Maximum Length:**  
   Finally, the result is the longest sequence found during the traversal.

### Time and Space Complexity ⏱️📦
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`  
  We only need to traverse the array once, where `n` is the length of the array.

- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`  
  We only need a constant amount of extra space to track the lengths of increasing and decreasing sequences.

### Code (JAVA) 💻
```java
class Solution {
    public int longestMonotonicSubarray(int[] nums) {
        int ans = 1;
        int increasing = 1;
        int decreasing = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; ++i) {
            if (nums[i] > nums[i - 1]) {
                increasing += 1;
                decreasing = 1;
            } else if (nums[i] < nums[i - 1]) {
                decreasing += 1;
                increasing = 1;
            } else {
                increasing = 1;
                decreasing = 1;
            }
            ans = Math.max(ans, Math.max(increasing, decreasing));
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
```

### Code (Python) 🐍

```python
class Solution:
    def longestMonotonicSubarray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        ans = 1
        increasing = 1
        decreasing = 1
        
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > nums[i - 1]:
                increasing += 1
                decreasing = 1
            elif nums[i] < nums[i - 1]:
                decreasing += 1
                increasing = 1
            else:
                increasing = 1
                decreasing = 1
            ans = max(ans, max(increasing, decreasing))
        
        return ans
```

### Code (C++) 🔩

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestMonotonicSubarray(vector<int>& nums) {
        int ans = 1;
        int increasing = 1;
        int decreasing = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            if (nums[i] > nums[i - 1]) {
                increasing += 1;
                decreasing = 1;
            } else if (nums[i] < nums[i - 1]) {
                decreasing += 1;
                increasing = 1;
            } else {
                increasing = 1;
                decreasing = 1;
            }
            ans = max(ans, max(increasing, decreasing));
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
